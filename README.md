## Lightning Talks

The goal here is three fold.
- First to get you comfortable with talking through technical topics in front of a group
- Second to expose you to more knowledge than you otherwise would have been in Phase 2.
- Third to get you comfortable documenting technical data and sharing it with your peers.

### Topics

[Week 1](1-week.md)
[Week 2](2-week.md)

### Sign up

Everyone will do a minimum of 1 lightning talk every week. If you're feeling extra froggy, you can sign up for more...

To sign-up for a talk:

1. Check if there are any open pull request to the guide for lightning talks.
Merge these into master(on github).
2. Clone a copy of the this repo to your local machine (if you have previously
cloned then pull the latest version of master).
3. Create a branch named "your-name-volunteers-for--talk-x-on-day-y"
4. Put your name in front of the talk title.
5. Submit a pull request!  (and get someone else to merge it)

### Submission

Submitting your lightning talk comes in two parts. Both must be completed to receive credit for the talk.

1. Giving the talk itself.

- Lightning talks are 4~5 minute talks covering a topic or answering a question.
- Because you only have 5 minutes, you must prioritize what is the most important part of a topic.
- You can whiteboard out complex topics on a mobile board before we start.
- Lightning talks are whiteboard and speech based only. (No computers)
- Lightning talks will be conducted each day immediately after 2:00 stand-up and before breakouts.

2. Uploading documentation.

- Create a markdown file within the documentation folder of your cloned copy of this repo.
- The documentation should briefly cover the information you will present in your talk.
- Write up a bit of documentation around your topic.
- Add a link to your documentation to the documentation section of this document.
- Follow the process above for branching and merging this time with a branch name of "your-name-your-topic"
- Push up your file and open a PR
